<H1>About Me</H1>
I'm a freshman at the University of Maine, and I'm studying Business Management.  I love spending time in the outdoors. My hobbies include camping, hiking, working out, cooking, and reading.  I live on the beautiful coast about two hours from UMaine, and I'm happy to call Maine my home. I look forward to getting involved in clubs around campus!
